    <p id="letter1">My love, every day with you feels like a beautiful dream I never want to wake up from. Your smile lights up my world, your laughter fills my heart, and your love makes every moment magical. On this Valentine’s Day, I just want you to know that being with you is the happiest part of my life, and I treasure every second we share together.
    </p>
    <p id="letter2">From the moment we met when I was 14 and you were 16, I felt something special, and little did I know that our journey would blossom into the beautiful love we share today. Since 22/03/2019, we’ve grown together, laughed together, and created memories that I will cherish forever. Seven Valentine’s Days later, my heart still skips a beat every time I think of you, and I’m so grateful for the love that keeps growing between us.
    </p>
    <p id="letter3">No matter how many fights or challenges we face, I will always choose you because no one is perfect, but our love is perfect for me. Let’s continue to dream, laugh, and grow together, building a beautiful life side by side. Be my forever Valentine, my love, my heart, and my everything.
